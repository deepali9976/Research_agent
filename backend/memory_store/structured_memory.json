      "question": "Can we engineer living cells to produce novel molecules that can selectively target and remove toxic heavy metals from the body, thereby preventing heavy metal-induced toxicity and improving patient outcomes?",
      "reasoning": "Exposure to toxic heavy metals can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Developing engineered living therapeutics that can produce novel molecules to selectively target and remove toxic heavy metals would be a significant breakthrough in environmental health.
